  	description: 'San (さん), sometimes pronounced han (はん) in Kansai dialect, is the most commonplace honorific and is a title of respect typically used between equals of any age. Although the closest analog in English are the honorifics "Mr.", "Miss", "Ms.", or "Mrs.", -san is almost universally added to a person\'s name; -san can be used in formal and informal contexts, regardless of the person\'s gender. Because it is the most common honorific, it is also the most often used to convert common nouns into proper ones, as seen below.'

  	},
  	description: "Sama(様, さま) is a more respectful version for individuals of a higher rank than oneself. Appropriate usages include divine entities, guests or customers (such as a sports venue announcer addressing members of the audience), and sometimes towards people one greatly admires. Supposedly, it\	's the root word for -san and there is no major evidence suggesting otherwise. Deities such as native Shinto kami and Jesus Christ are referred to as kami-sama, meaning \"Revered spirit-sama\". When used to refer to oneself, -sama expresses extreme arrogance (or self-effacing irony), as in praising oneself to be of a higher rank, as with ore-sama (俺様, \"my esteemed self\")."

  	description: "Kun (君【くん】) is generally used by people of senior status addressing or referring to those of junior status, by anyone addressing or it can be used when referring to men in general, male children or male teenagers, or among male friends. It can be used by males or females when addressing a male to whom they are emotionally attached, or who they have known for a long time. Although it may seem rude in workplaces,the suffix is also used by seniors when referring to juniors in both academic situations and workplaces, more typically when the two people are associated Although -kun is generally used for boys, it is not a hard rule. For example, -kun can be used to name a close personal friend or family member of any gender. In business settings, young female employees are addressed as -kun by older males of senior status. It can be used by male teachers addressing their female students.",

    description: "Chan (ちゃん) expresses that the speaker finds a person endearing. In general, -chan is used for young children, close friends, babies, grandparents and sometimes female adolescents. It may also be used towards cute animals, lovers, or a youthful woman. Chan is not usually used for strangers or people one has just met though."

    },
    description: "Tan (たん) is an even more cute or affectionate variant of -chan. It evokes a small child's mispronunciation of that form of address, or baby talk – similar to how, for example, a speaker of English might use \"widdle\" instead of \"little\" when speaking to a baby. Moe anthropomorphisms are often labeled as -tan, e.g., the commercial mascot Habanero-tan, the manga figure Afghanis-tan or the OS-tans representing operating systems. A more notorious use of the honorific was for the murderer Nevvda-tan."

    description: "Senpai (先輩、せんぱい) is used to address or refer to one's older or more senior colleagues in a school, workplace, dojo, or sports club. Teachers are not senpai, but rather they are sensei. Neither are students of the same or lower grade: they are referred to, but never addressed as, kōhai (後輩、こうはい). In a business environment, those with more experience are senpai. Senpai can also be used for someone you look up to or admire as more than a friend."

    	jp:"先生"
    },
    description: "Sensei (先生、せんせい, literally meaning \"former-born\") is used to refer to or address teachers, doctors, politicians, lawyers, and other authority figures. It is used to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, such as accomplished novelists, musicians, artists and martial artists. In Japanese martial arts, sensei typically refers to someone who is the head of a dojo. As with senpai, sensei can be used not only as a suffix, but also as a stand-alone title. The term is not generally used when addressing a person with very high academic expertise; the one used instead is hakase (博士【はかせ】, lit. \"Doctor\" or \"PhD\")."

    },
    description: "Shi (氏、し) is used in formal writing, and sometimes in very formal speech, for referring to a person who is unfamiliar to the speaker, typically a person known through publications whom the speaker has never actually met. For example, the -shi title is common in the speech of newsreaders. It is preferred in legal documents, academic journals, and certain other formal written styles. Once a person's name has been used with -shi, the person can be referred to with -shi alone, without the name, as long as there is only one person being referred to."
